Summary: This is my first post on this new blog. 

This is my first post on this new blog and I am planning to use this blog to share my throughts and 
knowledge in topics I am interested in. The topics will be mainly about technologies with deep focus on 
networking, Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity. I will try to keep the content focused on pratical use cases
with tutorials where you can keep your hands dirty on programming in different programming languages. 

Your comments on the blog posts and suggestions for new tutorials are highly appreciated. Stay Tuned.
